# Clustering Python Project

## Introduction

This project was commissioned by ENSAE during the first year of the engineering program. It involves creating a visual interface that prompts you to answer questions in order to match you with groups of people, similar to a dating app. The algorithm primarily utilizes PCA dimension reduction and simplifies potential biological factors.

ENSAE had imposed the guideline that external databases could not be used. Therefore, a part of the process involves artificially generating our own data.

## Usage
The algorithm generates a visual interface that prompts you to answer various questions. At the end of the questionnaire, the algorithm will find several people with whom you could potentially "match".

## Notes

This project was completed in 2021 when NLP and LLMs were much less popular. One possible improvement would be to use LLMs to match bios in order to enhance the matching process.
